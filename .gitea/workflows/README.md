# Gitea Actions Quality Gates

Gitea PR validation is the source of truth. Local hooks are only convenience checks for staged secrets and commit-message shape.

Coverage threshold defaults to `80%` from `.codex/quality.example.json`. Local development may override it with ignored `.codex/quality.local.json`; CI falls back to the tracked example when no local config is present.

The local runner executes PR validation inside a pinned .NET SDK container. Keep checkout and security tools shell-based unless the job container explicitly includes `node`; JavaScript `uses:` actions can fail inside plain SDK containers. Validate runner compatibility after workflow changes:

```powershell
.\.codex\skills\configure-dev-environment\scripts\configure_infra_tools.ps1 -Mode ValidateGiteaActionsRunner
```

That check pulls the configured job image, verifies required tools inside it, and confirms the container can reach local Gitea through `host.docker.internal`.

Required repository secrets:

- `NEXUS_URL` - use `http://host.docker.internal:8088` for local Docker Desktop runner jobs.
- `NEXUS_USERNAME`
- `NEXUS_PASSWORD`
- `NEXUS_REPOSITORY`
- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
- `AZURE_DEV_RESOURCE_GROUP`
- `AZURE_DEV_WEBAPP_NAME`
- `AZURE_DEV_WEBAPP_URL`
- `AZURE_QA_RESOURCE_GROUP`
- `AZURE_QA_WEBAPP_NAME`
- `AZURE_QA_WEBAPP_URL`

Add equivalent PROD secrets before enabling PROD promotion jobs.

Recommended branch protection:

- Block direct pushes to `dev` and `main`.
- Require pull requests into `dev`.
- Update `main` only after QA passes, preferably by fast-forwarding the tested commit.
- Require the PR validation workflow to pass.
- Require the exact emitted status check context: `PR validation / validate (pull_request)`.
- Require coverage to meet the configured threshold.
- Require review approval or the configured review label.
- Block merge while `needs-changes` is present.

Release flow:

```text
feature branch -> dev -> DEV -> QA -> main -> PROD
```

The package workflow builds and publishes from `dev`. DEV and QA must deploy the same Nexus ZIP artifact for the same commit SHA.
